## API
The API that you’ll use for this app is [AccuWeather API](https://developer.accuweather.com/).
Please signup and create a new app in order to get an API key.
You will use 3 endpoints: [location autocomplete](https://developer.accuweather.com/accuweather-locations-api/apis/get/locations/v1/cities/autocomplete) for the search field, [get current weather](https://developer.accuweather.com/accuweather-current-conditions-api/apis/get/currentconditions/v1/%7BlocationKey%7D) and
[5-day daily forecast](https://developer.accuweather.com/accuweather-forecast-api/apis/get/forecasts/v1/daily/5day/%7BlocationKey%7D).
Please read those API docs.
NOTE: this API is limited to 50 requests per day. our recommendation is to save the responses
and use them locally during development.
